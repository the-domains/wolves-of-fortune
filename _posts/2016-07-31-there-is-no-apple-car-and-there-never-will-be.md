      BMW's i3 electric cars as a basis for its own electric car project,
      according to a new report from German publication... News of Apple's work
      on building an electric vehicle was first reported early this year with
      hundreds of employees reportedly working on the project after an approval
      from Tim Cook a year earlier.
