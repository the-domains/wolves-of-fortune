  "Growth is painful. Change is painful. But nothing is as painful as staying
  stuck somewhere you don't belong." ~Mandy Hale We all get stuck: paralyzed
  about a decision, unsure what choice to make. Stuck in resentment or
  disappointment we can't quite recover from. Stuck in a plan that's not working
  as anticipated.
