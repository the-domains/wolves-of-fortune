  Can a person ever be truly free from the woes of life that trouble them? From
  the wants and needs that never seem to be satisfied. Are we just convincing
  ourselves with empty promises and vague intentions? How many times do we have
  to tell ourselves what is wrong and what needs to be fixed.. before we
  actually go about the business of actually doing them? Of course logic tells
  us that itâ€™s different for everyone. Some, more fortunate, have had mentors in
  the form of guardians or teachers that taught them lessons that become great
  blessings.. and some others were blessed by divine intervention for one reason
  or another.

Can a person ever be truly free from the woes of life that trouble them? From the wants and needs that never seem to be satisfied. Are we just convincing ourselves with empty promises and vague intentions? How many times do we have to tell ourselves what is wrong and what needs to be fixed.. before we actually go about the business of actually doing them? Of course logic tells us that it's different for everyone. Some, more fortunate, have had mentors in the form of guardians or teachers that taught them lessons that become great blessings.. and some others were blessed by divine intervention for one reason or another.

The rest of us must discover things on our own.

Personally, I've experienced many avenues in life. From delving in the underworld to attempting to succeed in the corporate world and everything in between. I've searched deep into the world of Personal Development and although I've grown greatly as a person and a man, the path of personal growth never ends. Fortunately one of the major gifts of knowledge and experience my parents bestowed on me is the gift of fortitude and persistence.

So.. on and on we go. No one should ever give themselves enough reasons to give up on their dreams, wants and needs. This is our God given right.

Jay.
