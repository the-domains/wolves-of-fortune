  Growth is a blessing for all brands, if they are profitable. For luxury
  brands, however, it is a mixed one. Growth is not an issue for premium brands
  (eg top German automotive brands), which in principle do not set volume limits
  but instead seek to gain market share and new consumers by always improving
  the performance and services of their products.
