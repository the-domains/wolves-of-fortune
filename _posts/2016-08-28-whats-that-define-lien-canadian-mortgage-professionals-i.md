  Okay, first of all let's talk about pronunciation. In English, lien can be
  said one of two ways: as one syllable, so it sounds like lean (rhymes with
  mean), or as two syllables, so it sounds like LEE-uhn. Both are correct, and
  we'll even accept the French lee-EHN, so pick one you prefer or rotate between
  the three.
