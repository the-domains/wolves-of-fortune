  Two plane loads of Canadian Olympians returned home from Rio to a hero's
  welcome, as flag-waving fans clamoured for autographs and cheering family
  members offered up homecoming hugs. Several members of Team Canada, including
  star swimmer Penny Oleksiak, landed at Toronto's Pearson International Airport
  around 6 a.m., with another group of athletes scheduled to arrive at around
  the same time early Wednesday.
